# Geopardy!
***NOTE: THIS IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND IS NOT FINISHED.***

This is an interactive Jeopardy!-style review game for AP Human Geography. Players can select questions from different categories and difficulty levels, and teams compete to answer the questions correctly.  

## How to Play

1. First, you gotta add teams! Teams can be added by clicking the "Add Team" button. There are no limits, so go nuts!  

2. The game board is displayed with 7 columns of questions in different categories: Units 1 through 7. The point value for each question increases from top to bottom.  

3. To select a question, click on its point value. The full question will appear on the screen. Teams should discuss and determine the answer to the question.  

4. Once a team knows the answer, click the "Reveal Answer" button. The answer and "Correct" and "Incorrect" buttons will appear.  

5. If the answer given was correct, click "Correct" and enter the number of the team that answered. Their point total will increase by the point value of the question. The question will be disabled since it has been answered.   

6. If the answer given was incorrect, click "Incorrect". The question will be disabled since it has been answered incorrectly. No points will be awarded.  

7. The game ends once all questions have been answered or disabled. The team with the highest point total wins!
